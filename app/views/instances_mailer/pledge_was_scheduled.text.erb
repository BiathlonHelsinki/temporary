Hi!


An experiment you pledged to was scheduled!

You pledged to the Temporary experiment proposal: <%= @proposal.name %>
  
The proposal has been scheduled!
  
The experiment(s) will take place on:
  <% @proposal.instances.published.future.each do |exp| %>
    <%= link_to exp.name, experiment_instance_url(exp.experiment, exp) %><%= " (#{exp.start_at.strftime('%-d %B %Y')} starting at #{exp.start_at.strftime('%H:%M')})" %>
  <% end %>
  
If there is any discussion to be had before the experiment takes place, you can comment on the experiment at the <%= link_to 'experiment page', @proposal.instances.first.experiment %>.

If you don't want to receive these (or any other) emails from Temporary, you can unsubscribe from notifications from your <%= link_to 'user profile page', edit_user_url(@user) %>. If you do want to receive these emails, make sure admin@temporary.fi is whitelisted in your email client.
  
Thank you for your interest in Temporary/Biathlon. See you at the experiment!
