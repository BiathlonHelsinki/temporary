          You may still pledge additional Temps towards it, however.

          This proposal still needs

          to be considered for scheduling.

          Currently,
          = @current_rate.to_s + ENV['currency_symbol']
          are needed before an experiment can be reviewed for scheduling.
          You may pledge a maximum of
          = "#{@item.maximum_pledgeable(current_user)}#{ENV['currency_symbol']}"
          to this proposal.
